The guidance that is provided on a non-GAAP basis cannot be reconciled to the closest GAAP measures without unreasonable effort because of the unpredictability of the amounts and timing of events affecting the items Akamai excludes from non-GAAP measures. For example, stock-based compensation is unpredictable for Akamai's performance-based awards, which can fluctuate significantly based on current expectations of the future achievement of performance-based targets. Amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are all impacted by the timing and size of potential future actions, which are difficult to predict. In addition, from time to time, Akamai excludes certain items that occur infrequently, which are also inherently difficult to predict and estimate. It is also difficult to predict the tax effect of the items Akamai excludes and to estimate certain discrete tax items, such as the resolution of tax audits or changes to tax laws. As such, the costs that are being excluded from non-GAAP guidance are difficult to predict and a reconciliation or a range of results could lead to disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of the exclusions could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.

Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and interest expense in this table excludes amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and interest expense related to cloud-computing arrangements and contract fulfillment costs. However, the amounts are included in our total amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation and interest expense that is excluded from our non-GAAP measures (see reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures).
(3)
Capital expenditures presented in this table are reported on an accrual basis, which differs from the cash-basis presentation in the statements of cash flows. The primary difference between the two is the change in purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs accrued for, but not paid, at period end versus prior periods.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), Akamai provides additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP financial measures). Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate Akamai's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP tax rate, capital expenditures, non-GAAP depreciation and amortization, capex as a percentage of revenue and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below.
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Akamai's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparison of financial results across accounting periods and may be comparable to those of our peer companies. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate Akamai's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of Akamai's ongoing operating results.
The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of Akamai's GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Akamai's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Akamai has provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in its financial reporting and investor presentations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This reconciliation can be found in the ""Supplemental Financial Information"" on the Investor Relations section of Akamai's website.
The non-GAAP adjustments, and Akamai's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:
Amortization of acquired intangible assets – Akamai has incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in its GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions Akamai has made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and is unique to each acquisition; therefore, Akamai excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results.
Stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation – Stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to Akamai's employees which includes long-term incentive plans to encourage retention, performance-based plans to encourage achievement of specified financial targets, short-term incentive awards with a one year vest and shares issued as part of a retirement savings program. The grant date fair value of the stock-based compensation awards varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of Akamai's current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, Akamai believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of Akamai's core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate its performance and compare its operating results to peer companies.
Acquisition-related costs – Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities. Acquisition-related costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions, and Akamai excludes acquisition-related costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of operating results to prior periods and to peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition transactions and do not reflect Akamai's core operations.
Restructuring charge – Akamai has incurred restructuring charges from programs that have significantly changed either the scope of the business undertaken by the Company or the manner in which that business is conducted. These charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions, impairments of long-lived assets that will no longer be used in operations (including acquired intangible assets, right-of-use assets, other facility-related property and equipment and internal-use software) and termination fees for any contracts cancelled as part of these programs. Akamai excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.
Amortization of debt issuance costs and capitalized interest expense – The issuance costs of Akamai's convertible senior notes are amortized to interest expense and are excluded from Akamai's non-GAAP results because management believes the non-cash amortization expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance.
Gains and losses on cost method investments – Akamai has recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of cost method investments. Akamai believes excluding these amounts from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to these gains and losses are not representative of Akamai's core business operations and ongoing operating performance.
Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items – The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as the impact of intercompany sales of intellectual property related to acquisitions), if any. Akamai believes that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows Akamai to highlight income attributable to its core operations.
Akamai's definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures are outlined below:
Non-GAAP income from operations – GAAP income from operations adjusted for the following items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized interest expense; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; legal settlements; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.
Non-GAAP operating margin – Non-GAAP income from operations stated as a percentage of revenue.
Non-GAAP net income – GAAP net income adjusted for the following tax-affected items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; legal settlements; amortization of debt issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; gains and losses on cost method investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.
Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, or EPS – Non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to Akamai pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuances of Akamai's convertible senior notes. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, Akamai would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of operating performance. With respect to the convertible senior notes due in each of 2033, 2029 and 2027, and those that matured in 2025, unless Akamai's weighted average stock price is greater than $93.01, $126.31, $116.18 and $95.10, respectively, the initial conversion prices, there will be no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
Adjusted EBITDA – GAAP net income excluding the following items: interest and marketable securities income and losses; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; legal settlements; foreign exchange gains and losses; interest expense; amortization of capitalized interest expense; gains and losses on cost method investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.
Adjusted EBITDA margin – Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue.
Non-GAAP tax rate – GAAP tax rate excluding the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items.
Capital expenditures, or capex – Purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs presented on an accrual basis, which differs from the cash-basis presentation included in the statements of cash flows. The primary difference between the two is the change in purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs accrued for, but not paid, at period end versus prior periods.
Capex as a percentage of revenue – Capital expenditures, or capex, stated as a percentage of revenue.
Non-GAAP depreciation and amortization – GAAP depreciation and amortization (which consists of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, capitalized stock-based compensation, capitalized interest expense and acquired intangible assets), less depreciation and amortization excluded from non-GAAP results (which consists of depreciation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation, capitalized interest expense and acquired intangible assets).
Impact of foreign currency exchange rate – Revenue and earnings from international operations have historically been important contributors to Akamai's financial results. Consequently, Akamai's financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, when the local currencies of our international subsidiaries weaken, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted.

Because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. The dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. The percentage growth rate impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, sometimes referred to as constant currency, is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period.

"Inception Raises $50M to Power Diffusion LLMs, Increasing LLM Speed and Efficiency by up to 10X and Unlocking Real-Time, Accessible AI Applications",Business Wire,"Thu, November 6, 2025 at 10:30 PM GMT+9","New funding will scale the development of faster, more efficient AI models for text, voice, and code
Inception dLLMs have already demonstrated 10x speed and efficiency gains over traditional LLMs
PALO ALTO, Calif., November 06, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Inception, the company pioneering diffusion large language models (dLLMs), today announced it has raised $50 million in funding. The round was led by Menlo Ventures, with participation from Mayfield, Innovation Endeavors, NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm), M12 (Microsoft’s venture capital fund), Snowflake Ventures, and Databricks Investment.
Today’s LLMs are painfully slow and expensive. They use a technique called autoregression to generate words sequentially. One. At. A. Time. This structural bottleneck prevents enterprises from deploying scaled AI solutions and forces users into query-and-wait interactions.
Inception applies a fundamentally different approach. Its dLLMs leverage the technology behind image and video breakthroughs like DALL·E, Midjourney, and Sora to generate answers in parallel. This shift enables text generation that is 10x faster and more efficient while delivering best-in-class quality.
Mercury, Inception’s first model and the only commercially available dLLM, is 5-10x faster than speed-optimized models from providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, while matching their accuracy. These gains make Inception’s models ideal for latency-sensitive applications like interactive voice agents, live code generation, and dynamic user interfaces. It also reduces the GPU footprint, allowing organizations to run larger models at the same latency and cost, or serve more users with the same infrastructure.
""The team at Inception has demonstrated that dLLMs aren’t just a research breakthrough; it’s a foundation for building scalable, high-performance language models that enterprises can deploy today,"" said Tim Tully, Partner at Menlo Ventures. ""With a track record of pioneering breakthroughs in diffusion models, Inception’s best-in-class founding team is turning deep technical insight into real-world speed, efficiency, and enterprise-ready AI.""
""Training and deploying large-scale AI models is becoming faster than ever, but as adoption scales, inefficient inference is becoming the primary barrier and cost driver to deployment,"" said Inception CEO and co-founder Stefano Ermon. ""We believe diffusion is the path forward for making frontier model performance practical at scale.""
The funds raised will enable Inception to accelerate product development, grow its research and engineering teams, and deepen work on diffusion systems that deliver real-time performance across text, voice, and coding applications.
Beyond speed and efficiency, diffusion models enable several other breakthroughs that Inception is building toward:
Built-in error correction to reduce hallucinations and improve response reliability
Unified multimodal processing to support seamless language, image, and code interactions
Precise output structuring for applications like function calling and structured data generation
The company was founded by professors from Stanford, UCLA, and Cornell, who led the development of core AI technologies, including diffusion, flash attention, decision transformers, and direct preference optimization. CEO Stefano Ermon is a co-inventor of the diffusion methods that underlie systems like Midjourney and OpenAI’s Sora. The engineering team brings experience from DeepMind, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and HashiCorp.
Inception’s models are available via the Inception API, Amazon Bedrock, OpenRouter, and Poe – and serve as drop-in replacements for traditional autoregressive (AR) models. Early customers are already exploring use cases in real-time voice, natural language web interfaces, and code generation.

RedCloud To Use NVIDIA Tech to Target $2.8Bn Saudi Trade Opportunity,RedCloud Holdings plc,"Thu, November 6, 2025 at 10:30 PM GMT+9","RedCloud Holdings plc
LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RedCloud Holdings plc (Nasdaq: RCT) (“RedCloud” or the “Company”) the technology company behind the RedAI trading platform today announced plans to develop a new RedAI recommendation feature based on NVIDIA's cuOpt Optimization Engine in the Saudi Arabian market, unlocking an estimated $2.8Bn annual trade opportunity within the Kingdom's fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) supply chains.
The Company believes there’s an estimated $8Bn inventory gap2 of lost economic opportunity within the estimated $62Bn Saudi Arabian FMCG industry1, whereby overstock or understock of inventory leads to lost opportunity across the supply chain and empty shelves in stores. The Company believes that inefficient inventory management is a major contributor to this problem—where decision making on inventory orders using Economic Order Quantities (EOQ) of inventory are calculated in the absence of adequate market level data about predicted supply and demand in each product category and geography, optimum warehousing consideration and time-based logistics capacity.
RedCloud has chosen Saudi Arabia as its first target market for a new intelligent product feature based on NVIDIA’s cuOpt, a GPU-accelerated optimization engine that delivers calculations in seconds that previously took hours. The Company expects that this will enable more intelligent and automated inventory decisions, made possible by AI and the Company’s deep proprietary market data—to mitigate as much as 35% of the Inventory Gap, delivering an estimated $2.8Bn additional trade opportunity across Saudi supply chains based on adoption of this capability. On completion of successful pilots, the Company anticipates RedCloud Arabia’s investment in Saudi AI engineering talent—locating innovation as close as possible to customers and markets—to develop intelligent features for deployment across the Company’s operating markets.

“For nearly 90 years, Saudi Arabia has powered the world through reliable and affordable energy supply chains. Today, that same advantage will fuel the world’s AI factories,” said Majid Alghaslan, Founder of Kayanet Holding and joint venture partner of the Company. “The development of advanced AI capabilities in RedCloud Arabia reflects Vision 2030’s ambition to transform the Kingdom into a global hub, where technology, data, and intelligence redefine FMCG trade; building predictive, autonomous, and sustainable economies of the future. As we look towards launch of operations in Saudi Arabia, we are in advanced discussions with leading manufacturers and distributors across the Kingdom, who together contribute billions of dollars to FMCG trade.”
""We're building the intelligence foundation for global trade, and the Saudi Arabian market is a critical innovation laboratory for us,"" added Justin Floyd, CEO and Founder at RedCloud. ""The Kingdom's Vision 2030 to transform core industries and modernize the economy aligns perfectly with our mission to build the intelligence foundation for the FMCG industry, in the same way the Bloomberg did for financial markets and Google did for the internet. This transforms distributor operations from sales-driven operators into prediction-driven engines of growth and profitability to oil the wheels of an entire industry.""

As a member of the NVIDIA Connect program, the Company is leveraging the partnership to develop local AI engineering talent in Saudi Arabia. Should customer pilots prove successful, the Company intends to incorporate Intelligent EOQ as a global feature of the RedAI Trading Platform, with deployment across operations in Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria, and South Africa.
The Company believes this bold innovation directly supports Vision 2030's objectives of economic diversification and technology leadership, positioning the Kingdom as RedCloud's global innovation hub before worldwide rollout.

The announcement follows significant operational momentum: the Company more than doubled customer numbers year-over-year in the first half of 2025, launched a new partnership strategy for payments and financial services to maximize working capital across supply chains, and expanded its technology ecosystem through the NVIDIA Connect program alongside existing partnerships with AWS and Snowflake.
