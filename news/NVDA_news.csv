Aligned with a shift driven by NVIDIA toward 800-volt DC architectures for AI data centers, reinforcing the KARNO Power Module’s native 800-volt DC integration advantage
Recorded third-quarter revenue of $0.8 million and year-to-date revenue of $2.8 million, all from research and development services
Ended the quarter with $165 million in cash and investments, with year-end 2025 balance expected to be approximately $155 million
Executive Commentary
""This quarter marks a major turning point for Hyliion,"" said Thomas Healy, Founder and CEO of Hyliion. ""The KARNO Power Module is now meeting our initial customers’ performance requirements, enabling further system deployments in real-world applications. We’ve showcased the product’s reliability, fuel flexibility, and ultra-low emissions, and have received positive regulatory determination from the EPA that will streamline the deployment pathway for our customers.""
Product Performance and Readiness
Hyliion achieved multiple product milestones this quarter, confirming that the KARNO Power Module is now performing at the level required by initial customers. This progress enables the company to further expand customer deployments this year and into 2026 and keeps Hyliion on track for full product commercialization in 2026.
A key achievement this quarter was the successful completion of over 100 consecutive days of testing on a customer-configured KARNO Power Module with no unplanned hardware-related downtime. While the unit was not operated continuously during the test period, it accumulated extensive runtime across a broad range of load conditions and completed hundreds of start-stop cycles. These results validate the system’s durability, dependable architecture, and low-maintenance design.
Emissions testing by the company also confirmed that the KARNO Power Module can meet or exceed the most stringent local air quality standards, including those set by California’s South Coast Air Quality Management District, without requiring exhaust aftertreatment. In parallel, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a determination that the KARNO Power Module is not classified as an internal combustion engine under current federal regulations. This designation removes the need for federal engine permitting and allows customers to work directly with local air agencies, significantly simplifying the path to deployment.
The company also demonstrated the KARNO system’s ability to operate seamlessly on multiple fuels. In a recent showcase, a unit switched between natural gas and propane while under load, maintaining stable power output and real-time performance adjustment. This fuel flexibility highlights one of the KARNO Power Module’s key differentiators and broadens its applicability across diverse customer applications and fuel availability scenarios.
Hyliion completed a key milestone in its UL certification program. The KARNO linear electric motor passed all required tests on the first attempt, a result that underscores the maturity and robustness of the system’s engineering design. Remaining system-level testing is proceeding as planned, and full UL certification of the KARNO Power Module is expected to be completed in the coming months.
KARNO Commercial Updates
Since the introduction of the KARNO Power Module, customer interest has continued to build, with Hyliion having executed non-binding letters of intent representing nearly 500 KARNO Cores across a diverse range of applications. These agreements demonstrate growing demand from customers seeking reliable, clean, and fuel-flexible distributed power solutions. Based on current levels of interest, Hyliion anticipates being supply constrained for the years ahead as it scales production capacity to meet customer needs.
The company’s engagement with the U.S. Navy also continues to advance. The first autonomous naval vessel designed to be powered by KARNO systems is now undergoing sea trials, marking a major milestone in the Navy’s program. Initial KARNO installations are planned for 2026 under Hyliion’s ongoing R&D contract. The vessel’s architecture is designed to accommodate multiple megawatts of KARNO power, illustrating both the scalability and strategic relevance of the technology for defense applications where energy security and reliability are mission-critical.
Hyliion has also initiated exploratory work with a leading organization in the SMR sector to evaluate coupling KARNO technology with nuclear power. Since the KARNO system uses heat as its input fuel source, this effort will explore the potential to replace traditional steam turbines in SMR systems with KARNO Power Modules to generate electricity more efficiently. While still in the early stages, this collaboration represents a longer-term opportunity to expand the KARNO Power Module’s applicability within next-generation clean energy infrastructure.
In the data center sector, Hyliion’s technology is aligned with the industry’s planned transition toward high-voltage, direct-current architectures. NVIDIA recently highlighted this shift toward 800-volt DC systems as a foundational element for future AI data centers seeking higher powered compute, efficiency, and scalability. The KARNO Power Module’s native 800-volt DC output enables direct integration into these next-generation architectures without requiring costly conversion equipment, offering operators improved efficiency, reduced complexity, and lower installation costs.
Financial Highlights and Guidance
Hyliion recorded third-quarter 2025 revenue of $0.8 million from research and development services related to its contract with the Office of Naval Research. Cost of sales was also approximately $0.8 million, resulting in a small gross loss for the quarter. In the same period of 2024, the company recorded no revenue or cost of sales.
Operating expenses for the quarter were $15.3 million, compared to $14.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by higher research and development spending as the company continued to advance testing and production of KARNO components. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $5.2 million, down roughly half a million dollars year-over-year due to lower facility and insurance costs, partially offset by a small increase in labor costs. The company reported a third quarter net loss of $13.3 million compared to $11.2 million in the third quarter of 2024.
For the first nine months of 2025, Hyliion recorded $2.8 million in revenue, all from research and development services, with a gross profit of approximately $96 thousand. Operating expenses totaled $50.7 million compared to $47.2 million in the same period last year, primarily due to increased R&D investment, partly offset by lower SG&A and Powertrain Exit and Termination expenses. The company’s year-to-date net loss was $44 million compared to $37.7 million in the prior-year period.
Hyliion ended the quarter with $164.7 million in cash and investments and expects a year-end 2025 balance of approximately $155 million. Year-to-date cash use totaled $55 million, including $22 million of capital expenditures, primarily related to additive printing equipment and facility enhancements. The company continues to forecast total 2025 cash outlays of approximately $65 million net of planned equipment financing.
Full-year 2025 revenue is expected to be approximately $4 million, reflecting timing adjustments for certain early-adopter unit deliveries that have shifted into 2026. Hyliion expects commercialization of the KARNO Power Module to occur in 2026, at which time it will begin recognizing product revenue. The company continues to believe that its current capital position will be sufficient to fund operations through product commercialization.

"San Francisco Startup Tuurny Builds AI Robot to ""Mine"" Electronic Waste for Critical Chips",Tuurny,"Wed, November 12, 2025 at 4:10 AM GMT+9","NASA Grant Recipient and NVIDIA Inception Program Member, Tuurny Moves the E-Waste industry from ""Shredding"" to ""Surgical Harvesting"" to Solve Both the E-Waste and Supply Chain Crises at Once
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Nov. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A San Francisco startup Tuurny announced today it is developing a platform that solves world’s two massive, contradictory problems: a critical shortage of computer chips and a growing mountain of electronic waste.
The company, currently in its prototyping phase, is building an AI-powered robot that does what was previously thought impossible: it intelligently ""mines"" old electronics for valuable components, keeping them perfectly usable.
For decades, e-waste recycling has meant ""shredding"" a brute-force process that destroys billions of dollars in valuable chips, connectors, magnets, and capacitors, leaving only a low-grade scrap commodity. Tuurny’s autonomous ""scalpel"" approach is different.

Tuurny
Using computer vision, the system looks at a circuit board, identifies all the valuable parts, and then uses precision robotics to surgically remove them without damage. This proprietary process creates a new, high-margin, and secure supply of tested and documented parts from our own domestic waste.
""Shredding electronics is like putting a classic Ferrari into a car crusher just to sell the metal as scrap,"" said Sina Ghashghaei, CEO of Tuurny. ""You've just destroyed a priceless engine and transmission to get a few dollars of steel. We're the expert mechanics who surgically remove that engine, certify its condition, and make it ready for a new chassis. We are turning a toxic waste stream into a secure, high-value resource.""
The timing for this technology is critical. As global supply chains remain volatile, Tuurny is creating a new, domestic supply chain by on-shoring critical materials that are already here.

Tuurny
The company's advanced approach has gained significant validation:
NASA Grant: Tuurny was awarded a grant from NASA to collaborate with Texas A&M on the development of its advanced computer vision brain.
NVIDIA Inception: The company was accepted into the NVIDIA Inception program, which supports startups revolutionizing industries with AI.
While the platform is designed to extract value from all electronics, its unique documentation capabilities solve a critical challenge for high-stakes industries like aerospace and defense.
""Many long-life defense platforms rely on 'sunset' or legacy electronic components that are no longer in production,"" added Sina Ghashghaei. ""Sourcing these obsolete parts is a massive logistical and security challenge, with a high risk of counterfeit infiltration. Our system addresses this head-on by creating a digital certificate for every component it removes from trusted hardware, proving exactly where it came from. This provides a direct, automated way to comply with the Pentagon’s stringent DFARS 252.246-7007 (Counterfeit Electronic Part Detection and Avoidance System) mandate.""
Based in San Francisco with a warehouse in Texas, Tuurny is currently raising a Seed round to expand its engineering team, complete its first production-intent system, and launch its first paid pilot programs.
About Tuurny
Tuurny is a San Francisco-based e-waste robotics company building an intelligent platform for the circular economy. Its AI-powered systems move beyond traditional shredding to surgically identify, harvest, and database valuable components from electronics from chips and RAM to capacitors and connectors. Tuurny is turning the world's e-waste into a secure, traceable, and valuable on-shore resource.

CNCF and SlashData Report Finds Leading AI Tools Gaining Adoption in Cloud Native Ecosystems,PR Newswire,"Tue, November 11, 2025 at 11:00 PM GMT+9","New report provides maturity and recommendation scores for tools and projects across AI inference, ML orchestration, and agentic AI platforms
Key Highlights:
CNCF and SlashData's new report highlights the top AI tools gaining traction in cloud native ecosystems, with NVIDIA Triton, Metaflow, Airflow, and Model Context Protocol leading in adoption and developer trust.
For AI inference tools, NVIDIA Triton, DeepSpeed, TensorFlow Serving, and BentoML are the projects developers cumulatively placed in the adopt position. Further, NVIDIA Triton received the highest ratings for both maturity and usefulness.
In the ML orchestration category, Airflow and Metaflow rose to the adopt position. Metaflow earned the highest maturity ratings, while Airflow had the highest usefulness ratings.
In agentic AI platforms, Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Llama Stack reached the adopt classification. MCP leads on maturity and usefulness; meanwhile, Agent2Agent posted the highest recommendation score at 94%.
ATLANTA, Nov. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- , KUBECON + CLOUDNATIVECON NORTH AMERICA. – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, released new findings from the Q4 2025 CNCF Technology Landscape Radar report with SlashData, uncovering insight on developers' experience and opinions on AI inference tools and engines, agentic AI platforms and projects, and ML orchestration tools.

""Organizations building and operating AI systems can't treat tooling the way they did five years ago,"" said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF. ""What this new research affirms is that cloud native principles from scalable infrastructure and orchestration are foundational not just for backend apps, but for inference pipelines and agentic AI systems. Choosing technologies rated 'adopt' helps reduce risk and increase productivity.""
Inference Tools Show Strong Utility and Momentum
NVIDIA Triton, DeepSpeed, TensorFlow Serving, and BentoML are the four tools most developers place in the adopt position.
Triton leads across maturity (50% 5-star, 30% 4-star) and usefulness (41% 5-star, 38% 4-star), showing strong confidence from developers working on infrastructure-heavy AI workloads and reflected is its strength in powering production-grade inference workloads that businesses rely on.
Adlik was less used but most widely recommended with 92% of current or former users.
This suggests tools that meet specialized enterprise needs, such as model optimization or hardware-specific deployments, can build loyal user bases even without dominating across categories.
Further, TensorFlow Serving and DeepSpeed show strong overall approval across broader use cases, supporting an enterprise need for flexible deployment paths. Meanwhile, lama had the lowest maturity ratings (23%), showing that not all tools are equally ready for enterprise-scale deployment.
ML Orchestration Projects Mature Alongside Scale
Airflow and Metaflow were rated as adopt tools.
Metaflow leading in maturity (84% gave it 4 or 5 stars) and Airflow topping usefulness and recommendation ratings.
Notably, Airflow received no 1- or 2-star ratings in usefulness.
BentoML, a dual-category tool, earned an adopt rating for inference and trial for orchestration. This highlights that multi-role tools may succeed unevenly across domains.
Additionally, Argo Workflows and Kubeflow, both CNCF projects, were rated trial for orchestration.
Flyte and Seldon Core saw more moderate scores, with Flyte showing mostly 3-star ratings. This data points to room for growth among orchestration tools that serve general use cases but haven't yet distinguished themselves.
""These findings show just how diverse the AI/ML toolchain has become,"" said Liam Bollmann-Dodd, Senior Market Research Consultant at SlashData. ""Metaflow and Airflow are excellent examples of how developer trust is earned through stability and fit-for-purpose design. But even newer projects like Flyte and Seldon Core are showing traction that signals opportunity for differentiation.""
Agentic AI Projects Emerge With Mixed Perceptions
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Llama Stack were the only agentic AI tools to land in the adopt category.
MCP had the highest combined 4- and 5-star usefulness scores (80%) and the broadest developer base among top tools. This indicates that structured, agent-based design is finding true traction for enterprise use cases like AI-powered customer support.
Agent2Agent (A2A), while newer and less mature, received the highest recommendation rate.
94% of users would recommend A2A. This shows that developer excitement and perceived trajectory can outpace current capabilities.
Cloud Native Patterns Essential for AI/ML
The data shows that even when developers don't label themselves as cloud native, their AI/ML systems lean on cloud native architectures: containerization, orchestration, scalability, and reliability.
41% of AI/ML developers now identify as cloud native, which is expected to rise. CNCF continues to support this evolution by spotlighting reliable tools, supporting early projects, and offering community-driven guidance.
Methodology
In Q3 2025, more than 300 professional developers worldwide who use cloud native technologies rated familiarity, usefulness, maturity, and likelihood of recommendation for tools in three categories: AI inference tools, ML orchestration systems, and agentic AI platforms. Ratings were captured on a 5-star scale for maturity and usefulness, and transformed into net promoter scores. Technologies were then grouped into four radar positions: adopt, trial, assess, and hold, based on composite scores across usage, maturity, usefulness, and recommendation.
CNCF will be discussing these findings and more this week during KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 in Atlanta. Join upcoming events, including KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2026 March 23-26 in Amsterdam.
