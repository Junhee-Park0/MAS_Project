With strong brand recognition, engineering expertise, and a massive installed base, Otis remains a dominant force in the vertical-transportation industry.\n\nMichael Burry Says Tesla Is ‘Ridiculously Overvalued.’ Should You Ditch TSLA Stock Here?\n\nLucid Motors Is Now Cheaper Than Rivian, But Is LCID Stock a Better Buy for 2026?\n\nJamie Dimon Once Called Bitcoin a ‘Fraud.’ Now, JPMorgan Is Quietly Making Blockchain History and Betting This ‘Crypto Winter’ Will Be Short-Lived.\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter.

Over the past three months, OTIS stock surged 1.5%, underperforming the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) 2.9% gainduring the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, shares of OTIS dipped 6.1% on a YTD basis and fell 14% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming DOWI’s YTD gains of 6.9% and 11.7% returns over the last year.\n\nTo confirm the bearish trend, OTIS has been trading below its 200-day moving average since late July and under its 50-day moving average since mid-November.\n\nOn Oct. 29, Otis shares climbed 2.3% after the company delivered Q3 results. Net sales rose 4% year over year to $3.7 billion, beating consensus estimates by 1.1%, while adjusted EPS increased 9.4% from the prior-year period to $1.05, about 5% ahead of analyst expectations. The quarter’s solid performance was driven by robust organic service-sales growth and meaningful expansion in service operating margins, underscoring the strength of Otis’s high-margin service business.\n\nIn the competitive arena of specialty industrial machinery, Schindler Holding AG (SHLRF) has taken the lead over OTIS, showing resilience with a 17.2% uptick on a YTD basis and 21.3% gains over the past 52 weeks.\n\nWall Street analysts are cautious on OTIS’ prospects. The stock has a consensus “Hold” rating from the 13 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $102.37 suggests a potential upside of 17.7% from current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Kritika Sarmah did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
