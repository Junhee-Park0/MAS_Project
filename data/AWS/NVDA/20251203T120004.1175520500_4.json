That makes the build-out both transformative and vulnerable: “This frontloading of spending is necessary to realize eventual gains,\" BlackRock wrote.\n\nBlackRock said those pressures are part of a structural shift, arguing AI is helping propel stocks to record highs and that it “remains pro-risk and sees the AI theme still the main driver of US equities.”\n\nBank of America struck a similar tone, but with a more explicit warning about how the next phase of the boom could play out.\n\n“Is this 2000? Are we in a bubble? No,” Savita Subramanian, head of US equity &amp; quantitative strategy, said during BofA's outlook call on Tuesday. \"Will AI continue unfettered in leadership? Also no.\"\n\nSubramanian views the current environment as more of a pause than the start of a collapse, describing a potential “air pocket” where capital spending outpaces revenue growth. That lag between investment and monetization, especially around power and infrastructure bottlenecks, could spook investors in the near term.\n\nPart of that risk has already shown up on balance sheets. Hyperscaler capital expenditures have risen to 60% of operating cash flow over the past year, up from 30% a decade ago, according to BofA, but still far below the 140% peak in the dot-com era.\n\nThe firm also forecasts hyperscaler spending from companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) reaching $400 billion in 2025 and $510 billion in 2026 as the build-out continues.\n\nBut that near-term caution doesn’t mean the comparison to 2000 holds. Subramanian acknowledged that breadth and lofty multiples do “rhyme with 2000,” but pointed to several key differences this time around: Stock allocations are much lower than they were during the dot-com era, earnings growth has supported higher valuations, IPOs are smaller, and speculation in unprofitable companies is less extreme than the late 1990s.\n\nThose differences underpin BofA’s bullish long-term view. The firm sees the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) ending 2026 at 7,100, a target that sits on the conservative end of Wall Street’s forecast spectrum, well below firmer calls such as RBC’s 7,750 and Deutsche Bank’s 8,000.\n\nAllie Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.
