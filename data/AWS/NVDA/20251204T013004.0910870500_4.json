The third vessel was struck Tuesday as it headed toward the Turkish port of Sinop. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the earlier attacks as a threat to “navigational safety, life and the environment, especially in our own exclusive zone.”\n\nRussian oil and gas provide nearly half of Turkey’s total energy needs. The NATO member has come under pressure from Washington to reduce its reliance on Russia ’s hydrocarbons.\n\nWhen Erdogan visited Donald Trump in September, the U.S. president urged him to ease ties to Moscow, including in the energy sector. During the same trip, Turkish companies signed a multibillion-dollar deal with U.S. firms to buy liquefied natural gas.\n\nDefending Turkey’s purchase of Russian oil and gas, Bayraktar said Russia had proved to be “a very reliable supply to the Turkish market” since Turkish households started switching to gas in the 1980s.\n\nHe said, however, “it’s not a secret that we need to have a balanced supply portfolio. We don’t want to rely on one supply country or a few countries.”\n\nTurkey was “trying to diversify our supply countries and get competitive gas,” Bayraktar added.\n\nTurkey’s state-owned oil and gas company, BOTAS, recently finalized a contract with Russia’s Gazprom to supply gas, the minister said.\n\nTurkey also is engaged with Russia in nuclear energy. Rosatom, a Russian state corporation, is building a nuclear power plant on Turkey’s Mediterranean coast.\n\nThe Akkuyu power plant's four reactors are expected to generate around 10% of Turkey’s electricity when it comes online. However, the project has been beset by delays exacerbated by sanctions imposed on Russian entities in the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe first electricity from Akkuyu would be produced next year, Bayraktar said.\n\nThe project's administrators had turned to China to provide components that western companies were unwilling to offer due to sanctions, but it still suffers financing issues including $2 billion “stuck in JP Morgan for a long time” when the West froze Russian assets, Bayraktar said.\n\n“We need to play a moderator role to help release this money because this is going to be used in the project,” he added.\n]]&gt;</body></article>",
