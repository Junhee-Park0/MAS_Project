Guidance for next quarter’s revenue was better than expected at $342 million at the midpoint, 1.5% above analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.66 per share was 7.5% above analysts’ consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy GWRE? Find out in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).\n\nRevenue: $332.6 million vs analyst estimates of $318 million (26.5% year-on-year growth, 4.6% beat)\n\nAdjusted EPS: $0.66 vs analyst estimates of $0.61 (7.5% beat)\n\nAdjusted Operating Income: $63.43 million vs analyst estimates of $51.06 million (19.1% margin, 24.2% beat)\n\nThe company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $1.41 billion at the midpoint from $1.40 billion, a 1.1% increase\n\nOperating Margin: 5.6%, up from -1.8% in the same quarter last year\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue: $1.06 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.05 billion (21.6% year-on-year growth, 1.1% beat)\n\nBillings: $243.9 million at quarter end, up 19.1% year on year\n\nMarket Capitalization: $18.34 billion\n\nGuidewire Software’s third quarter was marked by strong momentum in its core cloud business, with management crediting accelerating adoption from both new and existing property and casualty insurance customers as a key driver. CEO Mike Rosenbaum noted that the company’s cloud platform maturity allowed for broader and deeper customer engagement, particularly as insurers sought greater operational agility. The integration of newly launched applications and the continued buildout of the partner ecosystem were highlighted as helping to meet evolving customer needs. Rosenbaum emphasized, “We continue to see accelerating adoption for Guidewire Cloud Platform and have plenty of runway to continue growing our core business.”\n\nLooking ahead, Guidewire’s raised outlook is underpinned by the expansion of its InsuranceSuite with PricingCenter and UnderwritingCenter, as well as the integration of generative AI capabilities. Management believes these new tools can address industry-wide challenges, including fragmented processes and slow response times, by streamlining workflows and enabling faster product rollouts. CFO Jeff Cooper added that early market feedback on these products has been encouraging, with customer interest supporting confidence in the updated revenue and profit guidance. Rosenbaum stated, “We are extremely excited about the opportunity our platform unlocks for us in new products, innovation, and generative AI.”\n\nManagement pointed to several factors behind the quarter’s performance, including strong deal momentum, the evolution of its product suite, and early traction with new AI-powered applications.\n\nCloud platform adoption: Guidewire saw continued momentum in cloud migrations and new customer wins, with eight additional cloud deals closed during the quarter, including major insurers in North America, the UK, Japan, and Australia. This was attributed to the maturity of the Guidewire Cloud Platform and a proven track record with large, complex customers.\n\nNew product expansion: The company expanded its InsuranceSuite by launching PricingCenter and UnderwritingCenter, targeting actuarial and underwriting process automation. These applications aim to reduce manual workflows and accelerate pricing and risk selection for insurers, addressing a significant pain point in the industry.\n\nProNavigator acquisition: Guidewire acquired ProNavigator, an AI-driven knowledge management platform specifically designed for insurance. Management highlighted that integrating ProNavigator into its suite will deliver instant, context-aware guidance within core applications, accelerating user productivity and supporting AI deployment at scale.\n\nGenerative AI integration: Generative AI features are being built into new and existing Guidewire applications, with the goal of improving operational efficiency and decision-making for insurers. Management described its open platform approach, inviting both internal and partner-developed AI solutions to foster innovation and flexibility for customers.\n\nEcosystem and partner strategy: The company underscored the importance of its ecosystem, emphasizing the role of systems integrator partners and the InsurTech Vanguard program in co-developing solutions and supporting customer success across global markets. This collaborative approach has been a differentiator in winning large deals and accelerating adoption.\n\nGuidewire’s updated guidance is driven by ongoing cloud migration activity, new product launches, and increased investment in AI-driven features, with management highlighting broad-based demand and pipeline strength.\n\nCloud migration momentum: Management expects continued migration of existing customers to the Guidewire Cloud Platform, supported by proven delivery at scale and high customer retention rates. This migration is viewed as a catalyst for recurring revenue growth, particularly as more customers transition multiple core applications simultaneously.\n\nNew product rollouts: The launch and adoption of PricingCenter and UnderwritingCenter are anticipated to create new revenue streams and cross-sell opportunities, as insurers seek to modernize and automate critical pricing and underwriting processes. Early customer feedback has been positive, but management acknowledged that adoption timelines may vary based on customer readiness and integration complexity.\n\nAI-driven efficiency gains: Guidewire is investing in generative AI across its suite, both through internal development and partner integrations. Management believes these capabilities can lower implementation costs, improve user experience, and expand the platform’s value proposition, though ongoing investment will be required to maintain technology leadership and manage the cost of supporting AI features at scale.\n\nGoing forward, the StockStory team will be closely watching (1) the pace at which existing customers migrate to Guidewire Cloud and expand usage of new modules, (2) adoption rates and customer feedback for PricingCenter and UnderwritingCenter, and (3) the impact of generative AI integration on both operational efficiency and platform differentiation. Additional focus will be on how well the ProNavigator acquisition accelerates AI-driven knowledge management within Guidewire’s ecosystem.\n\nGuidewire Software currently trades at $225.42, up from $217 just before the earnings. Is there an opportunity in the stock?The answer lies in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).\n\nYour portfolio can’t afford to be based on yesterday’s story. The risk in a handful of heavily crowded stocks is rising daily.\n\nThe names generating the next wave of massive growth are right here in our Top 6 Stocks for this week. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\n\nStocks that have made our list include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-micro-cap company Tecnoglass (+1,754% five-year return).
