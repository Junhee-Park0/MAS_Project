Meanwhile, the stock has declined 8.2% over the past three months, compared to the Nasdaq Composite’s ($NASX) 9.1% surge during the same time frame.\n\nLululemon’s performance has remained grim over the longer term as well. LULU stock prices have plummeted 52.3% on a YTD basis and 46.5% over the past 52 weeks, compared to the Nasdaq’s 21.5% gains in 2025 and 20.4% returns over the past year.\n\nLULU stock has remained mostly below its 50-day moving average since mid-February and below its 200-day moving average since late March, underscoring its bearish trend.\n\nLululemon Athletica’s stock prices plunged 18.6% in a single trading session following the release of its Q2 results on Sept. 4. While the company’s international sales soared 22% year-over-year, its Americas net revenues inched up by a modest 1%. Further, its comparable sales in the Americas dropped by 4% compared to the year-ago quarter. Overall, the company’s net revenues increased 6.5% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, missing the consensus estimates by 36 bps. Meanwhile, its EPS dropped 1.6% year-over-year to $3.10, but surpassed the consensus estimates by a notable margin.\n\nMeanwhile, LULU has notably underperformed its peer, Adidas AG’s (ADDYY) 23.4% decline on a YTD basis and 24.4% plunge over the past year.\n\nAmong the 30 analysts covering the LULU stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” Its mean price target of $185.88 suggests a 2% upside potential from current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Sarawgi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
