Headquartered in Houston, the company operates across North America with a large skilled workforce and plays a key role in supporting power-grid modernization, clean-energy expansion, and utility-infrastructure upgrades.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as “large-cap stocks,” and PWR perfectly fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this mark, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the engineering &amp; construction industry. With diversified capabilities across electric transmission and distribution, renewable energy projects, and underground pipeline services, Quanta is positioned as a major contractor driving the energy-transition and utility infrastructure development.\n\nMichael Burry Says Tesla Is ‘Ridiculously Overvalued.’ Should You Ditch TSLA Stock Here?\n\nLucid Motors Is Now Cheaper Than Rivian, But Is LCID Stock a Better Buy for 2026?\n\nJamie Dimon Once Called Bitcoin a ‘Fraud.’ Now, JPMorgan Is Quietly Making Blockchain History and Betting This ‘Crypto Winter’ Will Be Short-Lived.\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter.

Over the past three months, PWR stock gained 21.8% outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s ($DOWI) 5.8% rise during the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, shares of PWR rose 44.3% on a YTD basis and climbed 34.2% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming $DOWI’s YTD gains of 12.6% and 7.1% returns over the last year.\n\nTo confirm the bullish trend, PWR has been trading above its 200-day moving average since early May. The stock has been trading above its 50-day moving average since mid-September.\n\nQuanta Services’ stock climbed 1.2% on Oct. 30 after the company delivered stronger-than-expected Q3 2025 results. Adjusted EPS came in at $3.33, surpassing analyst forecasts, while revenue surged 17.5% year-over-year to $7.63 billion, also ahead of expectations, reflecting robust momentum in its electric and renewable infrastructure segments. The company also lifted its full-year revenue guidance to $27.8–$28.2 billion and reaffirmed a solid adjusted EPS midpoint of $10.58, underscoring continued confidence in its growth outlook.\n\nIn the competitive arena of engineering &amp; construction, Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (FIX) has taken the lead over PWR, showing resilience with a 77.4% uptick on a YTD basis and 137.1% gains over the past 52 weeks.\n\nWall Street analysts are reasonably bullish on PWR’s prospects.
