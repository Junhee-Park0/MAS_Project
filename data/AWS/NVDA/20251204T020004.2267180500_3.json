Meanwhile, MSCI stock prices have dipped 1.1% over the past three months, compared to the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLF) 9 bps uptick during the same time frame.\n\nMSCI has notably underperformed over the longer term. MSCI stock prices have declined 9.1% on a YTD basis and 10.3% over the past 52 weeks, compared to XLF’s 10.8% surge in 2025 and 6.1% gains over the past year.\n\nMSCI stock has traded mostly below its 200-day moving average since March, with some fluctuations, and along its downward-sloping 50-day moving average over the past year, underscoring its bearish movement.\n\nMSCI’s stock prices have soared 8.6% in the trading session following the release of its Q3 results on Oct. 28. The company delivered strong financials and sales performance, including record Q3 recurring sales in two of its largest product lines. Overall, its operating revenues surged 9.5% year-over-year to $793.4 million, but missed the Street’s expectations by a thin margin. Nonetheless, its adjusted EPS increased by an impressive 15.8% year-over-year to $4.47, beating the consensus estimates by 2.3%.\n\nHowever, MSCI has notably underperformed its peer, Cboe Global Markets, Inc.’s (CBOE) 29.9% surge on a YTD basis and 19.7% gains over the past year.\n\nAmong the 19 analysts covering the MSCI stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” Its mean price target of $653.41 suggests a 19.8% upside potential from current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Sarawgi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
