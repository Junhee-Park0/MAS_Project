Guidance for next quarter’s revenue was better than expected at $5.45 billion at the midpoint, 0.6% above analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.21 per share was 11.8% above analysts’ consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy DLTR? Find out in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).\n\nRevenue: $4.75 billion vs analyst estimates of $4.69 billion (37.2% year-on-year decline, 1.2% beat)\n\nAdjusted EPS: $1.21 vs analyst estimates of $1.08 (11.8% beat)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: $553.8 million vs analyst estimates of $478.7 million (11.7% margin, 15.7% beat)\n\nRevenue Guidance for Q4 CY2025 is $5.45 billion at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting\n\nManagement raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $5.70 at the midpoint, a 3.3% increase\n\nOperating Margin: 7.2%, up from 4.4% in the same quarter last year\n\nSame-Store Sales rose 4.2% year on year (1.8% in the same quarter last year)\n\nMarket Capitalization: $22.45 billion\n\nDollar Tree’s third-quarter results modestly exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, with management crediting its multi-price strategy, an expanded discretionary assortment, and operational efficiency as key drivers. CEO Michael Creedon highlighted that the company’s Halloween performance was especially strong, powered by an improved multi-price offering and careful inventory planning. The company also reported a broader customer base, with higher-income households increasingly shopping at Dollar Tree, but noted that traffic was slightly negative as ticket growth offset fewer trips. Management attributed the traffic trend to temporary disruptions from re-stickering initiatives and broader retail patterns, while emphasizing ongoing loyalty among core customers.\n\nLooking ahead, Dollar Tree’s raised full-year profit outlook is anchored in further gross margin expansion and additional benefits from its evolving multi-price assortment. Management expects continued seasonal strength, especially in the upcoming holiday period, and is focused on increasing trip frequency among new, higher-income shoppers. CFO Stewart Glendinning noted that future margin improvement will rely on sustained cost savings in freight and SG&amp;A, with re-stickering costs rolling off and wage growth expected to moderate. The company’s strategy also includes targeted marketing and in-store experience improvements to deepen customer engagement across all income levels.\n\nManagement identified the multi-price assortment, operational discipline, and an expanding customer base as primary contributors to the quarter’s performance, while acknowledging that traffic trends and store payroll costs influenced results.\n\nMulti-price expansion success: The rollout of multi-price items, especially in seasonal categories like Halloween, significantly boosted both sales and per-unit profitability. Management noted that each multi-price item sold delivered 3.5 times more profit than fixed-price items, and this strategy is expected to continue across future holidays and occasions.\n\nCustomer base diversification: Dollar Tree attracted 3 million more households year over year, with 60% of this growth coming from higher-income shoppers. While these newer customers spend less per trip than core customers, management sees substantial opportunity to grow their trip frequency and engagement.\n\nOperational efficiency gains: Improved supply chain performance, favorable freight rates, and disciplined cost management contributed to gross margin expansion. The company highlighted that store standards, training, and simplified routines led to cleaner, better-stocked stores and faster checkouts.\n\nSG&amp;A and payroll pressures: Higher store payroll, largely due to wage increases and the labor needed for re-stickering, weighed on SG&amp;A margins. However, management expects these pressures to subside as re-stickering activities wind down and wage growth stabilizes next year.\n\nInventory and assortment optimization: The company continued to reduce slow-turning inventory SKUs, freeing up shelf space for higher-margin, faster-moving items. This merchandising approach is intended to increase store productivity and profit per square foot over time.\n\nDollar Tree’s forward outlook is shaped by the continued rollout of multi-price products, operational cost controls, and efforts to deepen customer engagement, especially among new higher-income shoppers.\n\nMulti-price penetration to expand: Management anticipates that expanding the multi-price assortment will remain a major growth lever, as customers respond positively to more varied and relevant products. This strategy is expected to drive higher average tickets and improve merchandise margins, though the optimal mix will evolve based on customer feedback and seasonal trends.\n\nSG&amp;A leverage and cost discipline: Projected moderation in wage growth and the end of re-stickering costs should allow SG&amp;A per store to grow below the rate of inflation. Management is also targeting efficiencies in store operations and corporate expenses to enable further operating leverage.\n\nCustomer frequency and loyalty focus: The company aims to increase visit frequency among new and existing customers through improved in-store experiences, targeted marketing, and a continually refreshed assortment. Management believes deepening engagement across all income levels is crucial for sustaining comp growth.\n\nLooking forward, the StockStory team is monitoring (1) ongoing execution of the multi-price rollout across everyday and seasonal categories, (2) the pace of improvement in customer traffic and trip frequency, particularly among new higher-income shoppers, and (3) the company’s ability to maintain gross margin gains as wage and logistics pressures evolve. Developments in inventory productivity and in-store experience will also be key signposts for Dollar Tree’s progress.\n\nDollar Tree currently trades at $113.29, up from $108.99 just before the earnings. At this price, is it a buy or sell? The answer lies in our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).\n\nIf your portfolio success hinges on just 4 stocks, your wealth is built on fragile ground. You have a small window to secure high-quality assets before the market widens and these prices disappear.\n\nDon’t wait for the next volatility shock. Check out our Top 6 Stocks for this week. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\n\nStocks that have made our list include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-small-cap company Comfort Systems (+782% five-year return).
