Meanwhile, the government is considering investments in U.S. gas to diversify its supply base. Liquefied natural gas is also in the mix, with Ankara recently inking several contracts for long-term supply, the bulk from the United States as well.\n\nThe investments will focus on LNG exporting facilities as Ankara seeks to hedge its pledge to purchase 1,500 cargos of U.S. liquefied gas over the next 15 years, Bayraktar also said. “To hedge our position and create the whole value chain, we are considering to invest in the upstream in the U.S. market,” the official said. Negotiations with U.S. LNG producers include Chevron, he also said.\n\nThe United States is currently Turkey’s fourth-largest gas supplier, delivering 5.5 billion cu m this year, for a market share of 14%. Turkey is currently working to boost its LNG import capacity in line with its plans to become a regional gas hub. To that end, two more floating regasification units are set to be installed at Turkish ports in the coming years, adding to three existing floating terminals and two onshore facilities to regasify LNG, with a capacity of 50 billion cu m annually, Reuters noted in its report.\n\nIn pipeline gas, Turkey is in talks to extend a supply deal with Iran that expires in July 2026. The deal covers deliveries of 10 billion cu m, both from Iran and from Turkmenistan.\n\n“We'd like to increase the capacity of Turkmen gas coming through the swap deal,” Bayraktar told media. Turkey earlier this year signed a deal for 1.3 billion cu m of Turkmen gas, to be transited via Iran.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nPakistan Inks Five Oil and Gas Exploration Deals\n\nSoaring U.S. Natural Gas Prices Could Boost Coal Power Generation\n\nChina’s Oil Demand to Remain Weak Until At Least Mid-2026\n\nOilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.
