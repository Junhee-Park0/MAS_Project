The deal, if approved, would create the first coast-to-coast freight-only railroad.\n\nThe AAR said that analysis of three decades’ worth of federal data, industry metrics and case studies shows that railroads’ cost structure and operating model make them less vulnerable to volatility and better-positioned to recover from supply chain shocks.\n\nCost fluctuations are less likely to reach consumers compared to trucking, AAR said, since rail mostly serves manufacturers shipping  bulk and intermediate goods instead of motor carriers’ last-mile and retail distribution.\n\nThe study also found:\n\nA 10% acceleration in trucking cost growth correlates with a 2.3% rise in goods inflation, with just a 0.7% rise from rail\n\nTrucking cost shocks typically hit consumer prices within one to two months; rail cost changes are smaller, slower and fade faster\n\nThe analysis highlighted rail’s resilience compared to trucking. During the port congestion fueled by the Covid-19 pandemic, rail transit times briefly increased but quickly normalized. Transit times on the Los Angeles–Chicago intermodal corridor peaked at six days but rapidly returned to 4–5 days, ensuring inland movement without further pushing up shipping costs.\n\n“This resilience is built on sustained investments and long-term planning with customers across sectors such as agriculture and energy,” the study said. “Ahead of harvest season, railroads make forward commitments to absorb seasonal peaks and keep rates predictable, moving 25% of domestic grain and 40% of exports. In energy, rail reliably transports three-quarters of U.S. coal, helping reduce inflationary pressure on household energy bills.”\n\nThe group said rail’s fuel efficiency enables the average Class I railroad – the biggest by revenue – to move one ton of freight 480–500 miles per gallon of fuel, about three to four times more efficient than trucks.\n\n“Since 2000, railroads have improved fuel efficiency by 22%, reducing exposure to energy price fluctuations. If just 20% of long-haul heavy-truck freight shifted to rail, annual savings could reach $13 billion in fuel and $11 billion in reduced congestion and highway damage – benefits that ultimately flow to shippers, taxpayers and consumers.”\n\nUnion Pacific and NS say the merger would help speed freight movement while reducing the amount of truckload freight on highways.\n\nSubscribe to FreightWaves’ Rail e-newsletter and get the latest insights on rail freight right in your inbox.\n\nFind more articles by Stuart Chirls here.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nUnion Pacific delays rail merger filing\n\nPorts warn intermodal in the crosshairs of rail merger\n\nRail freight stays ahead of year-ago traffic\n\nBNSF on UP-NS merger: Don’t ruin a good thing\n\nThe post Ahead of mega-merger, railroads say they steady economy, supply chain appeared first on FreightWaves.\n]]&gt;</body></article>",
