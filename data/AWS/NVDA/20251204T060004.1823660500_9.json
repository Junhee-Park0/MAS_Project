Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nDespite its substantial scale, Dow’s stock has continued to face considerable headwinds. Its shares currently trade roughly 46.1% below their 52-week high of $44.04. In the past three months, the stock has fallen marginally, while the S&amp;P 500 Index ($SPX) 6.2% surge during the same time frame.\n\nLooking over a broader horizon, Dow has dropped 45.8% over the past 52 weeks and has plunged 40.8% year to date. By comparison, $SPX has climbed 13.2% in the past year and 16.5% in 2025.\n\nThe stock has traded consistently below its 200-day moving average and has recently climbed over its 50-day moving average.\n\nDow’s stock surged nearly 13% on Oct. 23, after releasing third-quarter earnings despite the company missing revenue expectations with sales of $9.97 billion. The rally was driven by an adjusted loss of just $0.19 per share, far narrower than analysts anticipated, along with strong execution on cost-cutting initiatives. The company has already secured more than half of its targeted $6.5 billion in near-term cash support, including $1 billion in reduced capital spending and accelerated cost savings. Increased volumes from new polyethylene and alkoxylation facilities along the U.S. Gulf Coast also supported margin improvement.\n\nHowever, relative to peers, Dow’s decline appears moderate. Its rival Celanese Corporation (CE) has fallen 42.3% over the past 52 weeks and 39.6% year-to-date.\n\nThe stock has received a consensus rating of “Hold” from the 20 analysts in coverage, with the mean price target of $27.11 reflecting a premium of 14.1% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Kritika Sarmah did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
