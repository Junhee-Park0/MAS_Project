Meanwhile, its stock prices have soared 23.1% over the past three months, outpacing the S&amp;P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 6.2% gains during the same time frame.\n\nIQVIA has slightly lagged behind the broader market over the longer term. IQV stock prices have gained 15.6% on a YTD basis and 13% over the past 52 weeks, compared to the SPX’s 16.5% gains in 2025 and 13.2% returns over the past year.\n\nIQV stock has traded mostly above its 50-day moving average since early June and above its 200-day moving average since late July, underscoring its bullish trend.\n\nIQVIA’s stock prices observed a marginal uptick in the trading session following the release of its better-than-expected Q3 results on Oct. 28. The company registered a notable growth in organic revenues and also observed favourable currency movement. This led to a 5.2% year-over-year growth in topline to $4.1 billion, beating the Street’s expectations by 86 bps.
